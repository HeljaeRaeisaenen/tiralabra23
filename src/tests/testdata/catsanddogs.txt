I like cats. You like dogs. I want a cat. Is your cat like my cat? You like your dog. I like your dog too.

My cat is red. Some cats are black and some are white. Your dog doesn't like my cat.
Some cats are friendly to dogs, but not to other cats. Dogs often wag their tail.
I often wonder what is it like to be a cat or a dog.
