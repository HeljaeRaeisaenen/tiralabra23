# Testing documentation

This project uses automated and end-to-end testing.

## Automated testing
Automated testing is done with the pytest library. The three main modules of the program are tested this way: trie, read_file and markov_process.

### Trie and its nodes
The tests for the trie and node data structures help ensure that they work as intended.
