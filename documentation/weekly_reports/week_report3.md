# Week report
Week 3

Hours: 7

## What did I do?
This week I fixed the way my trie works, because I had done it wrong. Now my program is pretty much complete, though it can still be improved. Its UI is also bare minimum still.

Out of curiosoty I compared the text produced by my program to that produced by [markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify). I found that my program created sentences that are uglier (contain not-closed quotations etc.), sound less meaningful, but also repeat word-for-word much shorter excerpts from the training material.

## How did I progress?
The main functionality of the program is done.

## What did I learn?
Not much

## Problems
I had to use my time on other things this week.

## What next?
Next I will try to improve the appearance of my produced text, by making capitalization, quotes etc. work. I'll also work on the UI, and research whether I could imoprove my Markov process.
