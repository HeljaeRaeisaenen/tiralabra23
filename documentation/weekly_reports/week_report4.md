# Week report
Week 4

Hours: 10

## What did I do?
This week I wrote documentation and tested the program. I tried to make the generated sentences prettier, and managed to hard-code the program into closing opened quotes, and avoiding closing unopened quotes. This did't always work and sometimes terminates the sentence abruptly. The solution I made was very hacky and illogical, though, and I decided to undo it, because the resulting sentences were not significantly prettier than those made without this solution.

I also read more about Markov chain text generation to inspire myself to improve the program.

## How did I progress?
I made documentation.

## What did I learn?
I learned that Victor Hugo's Les Miserables is 545 925 words long. 

## Problems
I feel unmotivated because the biggest part is done.

## What next?
Next I will refactor my code and improve the UI.
