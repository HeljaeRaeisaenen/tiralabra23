# Week report
Week 4

Hours: 8

## What did I do?
This week I wrote documentation and tested the program. I tried to make the generated sentences prettier, and managed to hard-code the program into closing opened quotes, and avoiding closing unopened quotes. This doesn't always work and sometimes terminates the sentence abruptly, but most of the time the output looks prettier. The solution I made is very hacky and illogical, though, and I decided to undo it, because the resulting sentences were not significantly prettier than those made without this solution.


## How did I progress?
I made documentation and improved the program's output a bit.

## What did I learn?
I learned that Victor Hugo's Les Miserables is 545 925 words long. 

## Problems
I feel unmotivated because the biggest part is done.

## What next?
