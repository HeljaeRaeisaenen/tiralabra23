# Week report
Week 5

Hours: 12

## What did I do?
I changed the 'alphabet' of the program to treat punctuation marks as their own 'words'. This means that now a word is recognized as the same word whether or not it is followed by a comma. This allows me to control the opening and closing of quotes better. I think this improved the program somewhat.

I also created a real UI for the program.


## How did I progress?
I think the changes I made improved the program a bit, and I made an UI that is actually usable.

## What did I learn?
I learned how to work with paths better, use dotenv in Python, and change text colour in the terminal.

## Problems
None

## What next?
Next I will figure out how to further improve the program, and refactor the code.
