# Week report
Week 5

Hours: 7

## What did I do?
I changed the 'alphabet' of the program to treat punctuation marks as their own 'words'. This means that now a word is recognized as the same word whether or not it is followed by a comma, for example, and this allows me to control the opening and closing of quotes better. I think this improved the program somewhat.

I also created a real UI.



## How did I progress?
I think the changes I made improved the program a bit, and that's progress. 

## What did I learn?
